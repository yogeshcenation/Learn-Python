# Python-Programming-DS

This is a concise Python 3 programming tutorial for people who think
that reading is boring. I try to show everything with simple code
examples; there are no long and complicated explanations with fancy
words. If you have never programmed before click
[here](basics/what-is-programming.md) to find out what programming is
like and get started.

This tutorial is aimed at people with no programming experience at all
or very little programming experience. If you have programmed a lot in
the past using some other language you may want to read [the official
tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) instead.

You can use Python 3.5 or any newer Python with this tutorial. **Don't
use Python 2 because it's no longer supported.**

## Frequently asked questions

### How can I thank you for writing and sharing this tutorial?

You can star this tutorial. Starring is free for you, but it tells me
and other people that you like this tutorial.

Go [here](https://github.com/yogeshcenation/Python-Programming-DS) if you aren't here
already and click the "Star" button in the top right corner. You will be
asked to create a GitHub account if you don't already have one.

### How can I read this tutorial without an Internet connection?

1. Go [here](https://github.com/yogeshcenation/Python-Programming-DS) if you aren't
    here already.
2. Click the big green "Clone or download" button in the top right of
    the page, then click "Download ZIP".

3. Extract the ZIP and open it. Unfortunately I don't have any more
    specific instructions because how exactly this is done depends on
    which operating system you run.
4. Run `make-html.py` and follow the instructions.

If you have git and you know how to use it, you can also clone the
repository instead of downloading a zip and extracting it. An advantage
with doing it this way is that you don't need to download the whole
tutorial again to get the latest version of it, all you need to do is to
pull with git and run `make-html.py` again.
